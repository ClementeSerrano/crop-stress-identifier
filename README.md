# Crop Stress Identifier API :herb: :herb: :herb:

> Project stills in construction

Cool machine learning based api that classifies the type of disease of a crop proccesing hyperspectral data with different type of neural network models.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow

## Project structure

```
.
├── data                     # Knowledge base to train and evaluate the models
├── main.py                  # Main script of the API
├── nn.py                    # Multi-perceptron model (common neural network)
├── cnn.py                   # Convolutional neural network model
```

## Getting started

Just run `$ python3 main.py` on your project folder :metal:
